# SolidJS Rest Countries

I wanted to try out SolidJS because it seemed very interesting from the first moment that I heard of it. I thought [this](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/rest-countries-api-with-color-theme-switcher-5cacc469fec04111f7b848ca) challenge from [FrontendMentor.io](www.frontendmentor.io) could suit perfectly.<br>
If you want to learn more about SolidJS here's the [Solid Website](https://solidjs.com).

## Live version

The app is currently deployed through Netlify and is available at [this link](https://stunning-basbousa-09cca0.netlify.app/).

## Usage

If you want to run it locally you just need to:

```bash
$ npm install # or pnpm install or yarn install
```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev` or `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles Solid in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
